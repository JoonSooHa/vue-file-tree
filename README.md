# vue-file-tree

Customizable draggable file-system-tree component for Vue.js.  This component is meant to display files in the file system.  It is a wrapper around [sl-vue-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sl-vue-tree) and therefore quite a lot of the documentation for that Vue.js component applies to this one.

# Installation

In `package.json` put 

```json
"dependencies": {
    ...
    "vue-file-tree": "github:robogeek/vue-file-tree"
    ...
}
```
